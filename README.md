🛡️ Terraform Guardian

Terraform Guardian represents an AI-powered DevSecOps Governance Layer that could integrate into GitHub pipelines and enterprise CI/CD environments.

AI Multi-Agent Governance for Infrastructure as Code

🚀 Overview

Terraform Guardian is a multi-agent AI system built for Microsoft Agents League that analyzes Terraform infrastructure code and provides:

Structural analysis

Security policy review

Automated remediation

Executive risk scoring

It simulates an enterprise-grade AI DevSecOps governance platform.

🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

The system uses four AI agents:

Structural Analysis Agent

Security Policy Reviewer

Remediation Architect

Executive Risk Reporter

Each agent has a dedicated reasoning role.

🔍 Use Case

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is widely used in cloud environments.
However, misconfigurations can lead to:

Data breaches

Governance violations

Compliance failures

Operational risks

Terraform Guardian acts as an AI Governance Layer.
